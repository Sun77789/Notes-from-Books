Note that for displaying data, JSON.stringify() often works better than the canonical conversion to string:
	> console.log(JSON.stringify({ first: 'John', last: 'Doe' }))
		{"first":"John","last":"Doe"}
	> console.log(JSON.stringify([ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]))
	    ["a","b","c"]

Naturally, you have to be aware of the limitations of JSON.stringify() — it doesn’t always show everything  such as functions and more.

Pitfalls:
1. Not all conversions are invertible.
	> String(false)
	'false'
	> Boolean('false')
	true
For undefined and null, we face similar problems.

2.
